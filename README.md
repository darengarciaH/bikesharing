## Overview
This analysis explores data trends for a bikesharing service in New York City as it looks to expand to a new market in Des Moines, IA. This analysis looks into various data visualizations to better understand demographics of bikesharing.
## Results

The following are visualizations from the Tableau story:

This visualization shows the share of subscribers versus customers, with subscribers making up an overwhelming share.

This visualization shows the top starting locations, which seem to clustered around Manhattan. This would be indicative of areas that are often congested with traffic during regular commutes.

This visualization shows average bike trip length, which peak at about 10 minutes and tend to be under 20 minutes.

This visualization shows the number of bikes by gender, which are disproportinately male.

<img width="1213" alt="Screen Shot 2022-04-04 at 5 59 20 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92702922/161530655-72240212-993c-4c3c-8088-3441e5203cab.png">

Here, we see the distribution of bike rides across every hour of the day. Naturally, rides are more abundant during regular commute times of about 8 and 5 pm.

<img width="1209" alt="Screen Shot 2022-04-04 at 5 59 38 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92702922/161530684-82b8ddaf-0525-4f37-86e2-9cdd2cb14454.png">

Here we see the same visualization split by gender. Though there are more males using the service, the trend is the same for both genders: both men and women use the service mostly during regular commute times.

<img width="1205" alt="Screen Shot 2022-04-04 at 6 00 11 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92702922/161530715-4a227eaf-8512-49e7-9959-c649dd237045.png">

Lastly, we see the frequency of rides per weekday split by gender. The trend is similar to the previous visualizations: while men use the service more than women, both seem to use it mostly on weekends. However, men particularly show their busiest day being Thursday.

## Summary

The results are fairly indicative that bikesharing rides are a great alternative to other forms of transportation during high-traffic times, such as in weekday commutes, but also during weekends, which are often used for leisure. When we visualize these results by gender, we see the same trend across men and women. However, men use the bikesharing service considerably more than women do. It would be best to look into Thursday bikesharing data for men to see if there are enough bikes that can match demand for the service, and therefore to allocate resources accordingly. Given that Des Moines would be somewhat less busy than New York, it would be important to look at traffic patterns here, since they could also provide insight as to what the demand for a bikesharing service would look like in a city that is not as densely populated.
